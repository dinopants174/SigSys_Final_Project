    <h3>Project Overview</h3>

    <p>
      For our final project in Signals and Systems, we chose to study the Haar Wavelet Transform and apply it in both audio compression and image compression. We also used an FFT algorithm to compress the same image and compare the resultant image compressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first phase of this project, we sought a mathematical understanding of the Haar Wavelet Transform. Once we understood how the transform worked in both one and two dimensons, we began working on using the transform to compress audio, using our one-dimensional understanding of the transform, and images, using our two-dimensional understanding of the transform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mathematics is explained in the following two sections and we then demo our code and results.

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>function res = fft_compression(imagePath, threshold_factor, outputPath)
% This function takes as input the filename of the image you want to
% compress, the threshold factor which will be multiplied by the term in the
% Fourier series with the greatest magnitude, and the filename of the
% resulting output. The function ouputs the percent of terms in the Fourier
% series that have been attenuated because the magnitude of these terms is
% below the given threshold.
orig = im2double(imread(imagePath));
figure
imshow(orig)    %creates the matrix of the original image

Y = fft2(orig); %perform the fft on the original image
[rows, cols] = size(Y);
max_mag = max(max(abs(Y))); %determines the maximum magnitude of the terms in the Fourier Series
Y_compress = Y; %stores the original image in a matrix we will loop through and make sparser
count_orig = 0; %counts the terms in the Fourier series that are already 0
count = 0;  %counts the terms in the Fourier series that are attenuated to 0

for m = 1:rows
    for n = 1:cols
        if abs(Y(m,n)) < threshold_factor*max_mag
            Y_compress(m,n) = 0;    %attenuates to 0 terms in the Fourier series whose magnitude 
                                    %are below threshold
            count = count+1;
        end
        
        if round(abs(Y(m,n))) == 0  %counts how many terms in the Fourier series are practically 0,
                                    %without attenuation
            count_orig = count_orig+1;
        end
    end
end
compress = abs(ifft2(Y_compress)); %perform the ifft on the new, sparser matrix
figure
imshow(compress)
fin = uint8(255*compress);  %converts back so we can save it as a .jpg file
imwrite(fin, outputPath)

percent_attenuate = ((count-count_orig)/ (rows*cols)) * 100;    %calculates the percentage of terms in the fourier series that are attenuated

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
